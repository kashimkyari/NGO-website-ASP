                                        <p>
                                            Organ transplants are miraculous achievements of modern medicine which provide a viable
                                            approach to the management of diseases that cause end stage organ failure. They help such patients
                                            live long after they have given up hope but depend entirely on the generosity of donors and their
                                            families who are willing to give this life saving gift to others. Every year, hundreds of people die
                                            while waiting for an organ transplant. There is a serious shortage of organs and the gap between the
                                            numbers of organs donated and the number of people waiting is ever increasing. This where you can
                                            help by pledging your organs
                                        </p>

                                            A single non-living heart beating donor can save 7 lives by donating the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys,
pancreas and small bowel. Several tissues like cornea, heart valves, ear drums and bones, menisci,
tendons and skin could be donated. The Transplantation of Human Organs Act1994 (THOA) and
the Transplantation of human organ rules 1995 (THOR) as amended in 2002 provide for the
regulation of removal, storage and transplantation of human organs for therapeutic purposes the act
recognizes the concept of Brain Stem Death (BSD) and gives legal sanction for cadaver organ
donation. As of now there is no organization at the national level to control and coordinate organ
donation and organ sharing there are some organizations at the state level like ORBO (Organ
Retrieval & Banking Organization) at AIIMS; New Delhi MOHAN (Multi Organ Harvesting And
Networking) foundation at Chennai and ZTCC ( Zonal Transplant Co Ordination Committee) for
Maharashtra.

by singing a donor card. If you are under 18 consent of parent or legal guardian is necessary.
Alternatively, the family members of a brain dead person can offer the organs for donation. Medical
suitability for donation is determined at the of brain death of the individual

irreversible brina damage with cessation of brain stem function and such a patient is termed brain
dead. A brain dead person is medically and legally dead and cannot recover. With the help of
artificial support like mechanical ventilation and drugs, the heart may continue to beat for a limited
period of time but eventually it will stop functioning despite any medical support. Brain death is
certified after specific tests are performed twice over an interval of six hours by a team of 4 doctors
as per the guidelines issued by Govt. of India in Transplantation of Human Organs act 1994.

the surgical incision is applied. Relatives may see the body after the operation if they wish. The
process of organ removal does not interfere with the customary funeral or burial arrangements.

                                                        No. The doctors looking after a patient make every possible effort to save the
patient’s life. If despite efforts, the patient suffers brain, only then can organ donation be considered 
and a completely different team of doctors is called in. The patient is already dead and the ventilator
only keeps the body supplied with oxygen so that heart can continue to beat and circulate blood to
preserve the organs so they can be donated for transplantation.
