Greenhouses can be as big as a football field, or as small as a kitchen table. Some greenhouses have all see-through walls and a ceiling which are usually made of glass or a special plastic called "polyethylene". Plants are grown inside these building with clear walls and ceiling. The clear walls and ceiling allow the sunlight to pass through (which plants need to make their food in a process called "photosynthesis" while keeping out cold air. The gases in the air inside the greenhouse such as CO2 are warmed by the heat from hot interior surfaces are retained in the building by the roof and wall creating the greenhouse effect which is somewhat of a 'hot air concentration mechanism'. Due to such a 'hot air concentration mechanism' a greenhouse could even allow someone to grow tropical flowers in an Alaskan winter!</p>
