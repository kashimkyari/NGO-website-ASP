Use of any chlorine compounds is very harmful to the environment including bubbles in plastic foam, spray paint, fire extinguishers, bleach and a multitude of discarded household and industrial chemicals. Phosphates found in many laundry detergents and soaps contributes to water pollution and should be avoided. Aresols such as air fresheners and hair sprays can contain butane/pentane which contributes to air pollution and should be avoided. What out for products that are "bleached" white (ie.baby wipes, writing paper) and look for companies that offer the same products which are whitened with peroxide and chlorine dioxide which is less harmful to the environment. </p>
                                                                    <p>According to Seventh Generation, "boric acid and pepper sprinkled in places like backs of cupboards" are effective methods of pest control as a substitute for harmful insecticides and poisons. As well "planting mint around the house" will help discourage pests from entering your home. Cedar chips are effective for moth control, and even feeding your dog brewers yeast will help control fleas.</p>
