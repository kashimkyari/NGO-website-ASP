It is imperative that world leaders consider the consequences of their decisions and their subsequent impact on youth from the present time and those seven generations ahead, as dictated by the concept of seven generations sustainability inspired by the Great Law of the Iroquois which states.</p>
                                                                    <p> "In every deliberation we must consider the impact on the seventh generation... even if it requires having skin as thick as the bark of a pine."</p>

                                                                    <p>Youth education represents one of the most effective tools to combat the destructive potential of climate change and cultivate an international understanding among members of the next generation since it is a long-term process that will impact an infinite number of future generations.</p>
